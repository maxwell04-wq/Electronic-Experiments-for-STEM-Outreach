\subsection*{A New Way of Inflating Balloons}

To make the demonstration, you will need the following components:
\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|l|c|}\hline
     \textbf{\#} & \textbf{Components} &  \textbf{Amount}\\\hline
     1 & NaOH (Caustic Soda)    &  $\sim 30$ g\\\hline
     2 & Aluminum foil          &  1           \\\hline
     3 & Water                  &  $\sim 500$ ml\\\hline
     4 & Flask                  &  1            \\\hline
     5 & Balloon (deflated)     &  1             \\\hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section*{Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Take 500 ml water in the flask and dissolve NaOH in it.
    \item Add a few pieces of Aluminum foil in that flask and cover its mouth with a balloon.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Precautions}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Be very cautious during the experiment as it an exothermic reaction and heat is produced in the result. 
\item Do not use hot water for the experiment.
\item Protect your hands with gloves while dealing with NaOH. 
\end{itemize}
