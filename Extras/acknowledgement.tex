We wish to express our gratitude to our mentor and friend, Muhammad Hamza Waseem, whose inception of a science outreach program allowed us to embark on our journey of science communication and whose leadership has been both an insurmountable touchstone and an illuminating beacon for us.

We also thank our accomplice and partner in crime, Hasnain Irshad Bhatti, who has been a pivotal member of our team and has worked with us for many an outreach, projects and mischiefs. Our experience would not have been the same without his expertise and dedication.

A special thanks to IET On Campus UET Lahore for providing us with a platform to pursue our passion for science communication and an avenue to sustain our outreach program. Also, to IET UK for financing our outreach and streamlining its actualisation.
